## Description

This project has classes that extend the current Java FileIO library and gives additional functionality. It also takes advantage of the ASCII table to create encryption-decryption algorithms using characters in a certain range of the table

## Usage

You can use the existing algorithms in place or a combination of them to create your unique encryptions.
