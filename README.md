## Description

This project has classes that extend the current Java FileIO library and gives additional functionality. It also takes advantage of the ASCII table to create encryption-decryption algorithms using characters in a certain range of the table

## Usage

You can use this for either basic string encryption or extrapolate it into your existing application if it needs such functionality
